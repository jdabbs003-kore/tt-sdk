## Teltonika SDK Setup

This project contains scripts to set up and build the Teltonika SDK. For this to work,
you need to be a non-root user, in the sudoers file, on an Ubuntu 18.04 development machine. The
build step may take several hours. This is for illustrative purposes, provided under the BOOST 1.0
license, and it includes no warranty.

The project includes three scripts:
1. setup
1. download
1. build

## setup
1. `cd ~`
1. `wget -O ./setup https://github.com/jdabbs003-kore/tt-sdk/blob/main/setup?raw=true`
1. `chmod 755 setup`
3. `./setup`

## download
1. `cd ~`
1. `./download`

## build
